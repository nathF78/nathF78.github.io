      <description>Summary I have always been interested about IT and mostly about cybersecurity. So, when I had the opportunity to help organize the Toulouse Hacking Convention as a volunteer, I obviously proposed my help. The Toulouse Hacking Convention (THC), is an event that took place at ENAC engineer school between April 14th and April 15th. I proposed for 3 days, the first one was the day before the event to help with different installations tasks and then I helped during the 14th and 15th mornings.</description>
