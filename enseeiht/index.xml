      <description>Summary I have always been interested about IT and mostly about cybersecurity. So, when I had the opportunity to help organize the Toulouse Hacking Convention as a volunteer, I obviously proposed my help. The Toulouse Hacking Convention (THC), is an event that took place at ENAC engineer school between April 14th and April 15th. I proposed for 3 days, the first one was the day before the event to help with different installations tasks and then I helped during the 14th and 15th mornings.</description>

      <description>During my second year internship I had the opportunity to work at SAFRAN Landing Systems with Airbus UK. I was part of the Landing Gear System team, and I was responsible for the development of a new tool to automate the analysis of the landing gear system. This tool was designed to help the team to identify potential issues and to improve the overall performance of the system.
It was a work in an international environment, and I had the opportunity to work with a team of engineers from different countries (India and most notably UK).</description>

      <description>Emoji can be enabled in a Hugo project in a number of ways. :zap:
Emoji Support The emojify function can be called directly in templates or Inline Shortcodes.
To enable emoji globally, set enableEmoji to true in your site’s configuration and then you can type emoji shorthand codes directly in content files; e.g.
The Emoji cheat sheet is a useful reference for emoji shorthand codes.
N.B. The above steps enable Unicode Standard emoji characters and sequences in Hugo, however the rendering of these glyphs depends on the browser and the platform.</description>

      <description>The goal of the project was to make a music playing application. In our daily life, music is with us constantly (travel, relaxation, work, parties &amp;hellip;). Nevertheless, we are used to listen to compressed music of lower quality than in the past. Indeed, the streaming platforms (predominant on this market today) are compelled to compress their audio files in order not to overload the servers and the internet connection. But some users want to listen to music in CD quality.</description>

      <description>Personnal Project during my CPGE. A video being a series of images, studying the method used by the jpeg format to compress them would allow us to understand the fundamentals of lossy image compression, but also to see how to adapt its operation to meet new challenges.
